## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Goals

The theme system should provide:
1. **Seamless Experience**: Instant, smooth theme changes
2. **Visual Consistency**: All components work in both themes
3. **User Control**: Easy access to theme preferences
4. **Smart Defaults**: System theme as default for new users
5. **Accessibility**: Maintains readability and contrast standards

Test these goals by using the app as a real user would, paying attention to the overall experience rather than just technical functionality.
